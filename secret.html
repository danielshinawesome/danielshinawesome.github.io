    <p>Some roses are red</p>
    <p>But some are white</p>
    <p>In a world of darkness</p>
    <p>You are my light</p>
    <br>
    <p>Juliet roses are the rarest</p>
    <p>And aside from their stem</p>
    <p>They're different from the others</p>
    <p>And you're special, like them</p>
    <br>
    <p>And then there's the violets</p>
    <p>Only sometimes, they're blue</p>
    <p>But no one can doubt</p>
    <p>I will always love you</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Happy birthday, Taryn</p>
