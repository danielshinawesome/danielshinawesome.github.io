    <title>Hi Taryn!</title>

<body>
    <p>Congratulations! You found this file!</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Hi, Taryn. How are you? Oh, and before I forget, happy 14th birthday! This is your last birthday before you move back to Korea, so don't waste it!</p>
    <p>First of all, I'm really happy you found this file. It tells me that you really care about what I do for you, and that you didn't just look at my</p>
    <p>work and immediately put it away. I know sometimes when I send you really long texts you don't always read the whole thing. But I don't blame you!</p>
    <p>I completely understand. I do that sometimes, too. Also, I send you a lot of boring stuff that you don't always understand. Sorry!</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>...But I'm getting off topic. The point is, happy 14th birthday! I really hope you enjoy your stay at Korea, and don't forget to send all of us some</p>
    <p>letters and stuff!</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Yours,</p>
    <p>Daniel Shin</p>

    <p>P.S. Okay, I admit it: I printed out the Eevee image and then traced it with pencil on the poster. But still, I put a lot of effort into it! I spent</p>
    <p>more than an hour working on it, and I also risked my parents yelling at me when I did it. Trying not to brag here or anything but pls don't think I'm</p>
    <p>pathetic or something lol</p>
